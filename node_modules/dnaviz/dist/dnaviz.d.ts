 *
 * Example Usage
 * ```ts
 * squiggle('ATGC')

 *
 * Squiggle’s DNA visualization method is based on the UCSC .2bit format and the Qi et. al Huffman coding method. In essence, a DNA sequence is first converted into binary using the 2bit encoding scheme that maps T to 00, C to 01, A to 10, and G to 11. The bits can be mapped as end to end vectors.

 *
 * Example Usage
 * ```ts
 * yau('ATGC')
 * // returns [[0, 0.5, 1, 1 + 3 ** 0.5 / 2, 1 + 2 * (3 ** 0.5 / 2)], [0, -(3 ** 0.5 / 2), 0, -0.5, 0]]
 * ```
 *
 *
 * Yau et. al’s method uses unit vectors with upward vectors indicating pyrimidine bases (C and T) and downward vectors indicating purine bases (A and G). Similar to Squiggle, this method has no degeneracy.
 *
 * The unit vectors are based on 30 and 60 degree values on the unit circle.
 *
 * Specifically:
 *
 * ```ts
 * A = (0.5, -3**0.5/2) // ** represents exponents in js
 * T = (0.5, 3**0.5/2)
 * C = (3**0.5/2, 0.5)
 * G = (3**0.5/2, -0.5)
 * ```
 *
 * *Warning: The x-coordinate is not equivalent to the base position

 * Unique to DNAViz is the Yau-BP method, a slight modification of Yau’s method that ensures that the x axis is equivalent to the base position. It preserves that salient feature of the method, which is the purine/pyrimidine split.

 * Example Usage

 * // returns [[0, 1, 2], [8, 7, 11]]
 * ```
 *
 *
 * Similar to Randic, Qi maps each 2-mer in the sequence to a unique y-value. Because there are more 2-mer combinations than lone bases, Qi graphs look like randic graphs with a larger range of y-values.

 * gates('ATGC')
 * // returns [[0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, -1, 0, 0, 0]]
 * ```
 *
 *
 * In Gates’s method, DNA sequences are converted into 2D walks in which Ts, As, Cs, and Gs are up, down, left, and right, respectively. This gives each sequence a “shape.” However, there is degeneracy, meaning that a visualization is not necessarily unique. For example, TGAC is a square (up, right, down, and left), but so is GTCA (right, up, left, down).
